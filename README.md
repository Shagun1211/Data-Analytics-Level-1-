# Data Analytics Projects – OIBSIP Internship

This repository contains two Level-1 Data Analytics projects completed during my internship with **Oasis Infobyte (OIBSIP)**. The projects focus on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applying **data cleaning techniques** on real-world datasets using Python.
